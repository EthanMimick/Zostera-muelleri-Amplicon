The fasta included in hear is GSR-DB_V1-V3_cluster-1_seqs.fasta
and taxa.txt is GSR-DB_V1-V3_cluster-1_taxa.txt 
The id fasta created using the code in Creat_id_fasta only works for the V1-V3 16s region.
Both of which are available for download from :https://manichanh.vhir.org/gsrdb/GSR-DB_V1-V3_cluster-1.tar.gz
